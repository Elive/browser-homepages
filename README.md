# Homepages for your browsers

Simply clone this project, open in your web-browser (locally) the index.html file from each subdir, and you will see the different homepages!

The main goals of this project are:
* Having an ultra-fast loading of the homepage (no network trasfer waiting)
* Having an own beautiful design for the homepage set on the Elive browsers
* Include the useful links to the users (both for internet searching and Elive related things)
* Promote the donations to the project in order to maintain it alive
